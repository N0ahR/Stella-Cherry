 <br><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cultivar history &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
      <dl>
        <dt>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Skeena variety originated as a hybrid of two unnamed cherry hybrids. One of the parent varieties, 2N-60-7, was a hybrid of Van and Stella, while the other parent, 2N-38-32, was a hybrid of Bing and Stella. It was developed in Summerland, British Columbia at the Pacific Agri-Food Research Centre, for the purpose of providing a high-quality late-season cherry that matures about 14-16 days after Van. The cross was made in 1976 and selected in 1984. </dt><br>
 <br><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tree characteristic&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
        <dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The Stella cherry tree is a vase-shaped tree with a mature height of about 20‚Äì30 feet and a spread of about 15 feet. The tree blossoms early and fruits early, with moderate to heavy crops. Though it is considered a universal pollinator for other sweet cherry varieties, it has been found to not pollinate the Bing cherry variety in some regions.The tree can grow well in USDA Hardiness Zones 5‚Äì8. </dd>
<br><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fruit Characteristics&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
        <dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;- The fruit of the Stella cultivar is large, heart-shaped, and dark red, with overall excellent quality.[9] It ripens about 1 week earlier than Bing.</dd>
<br><h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compact Stella&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
        <dd>&nbsp;&nbsp;- A compact version of Stella was developed through X-ray irradiation of dormant Stella scions in 1964 at the Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York. This semi-dwarf variety of the cultivar grows to about half the size of the parent variety. It retains the parent variety's self-fertility and fruits early and heavily. It was named "Compact Stella" in 1973</dd>
